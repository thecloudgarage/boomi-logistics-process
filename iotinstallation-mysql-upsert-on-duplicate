Mysql UPSERT works via the DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statement
THe statement insert values will have x values, wherein the following on duplicate update will have x-1 (as id need not be there)
In Boomi, we need to import the actual profile from DB and then manually add the same fields again (minus id)
THe incoming map will need to be mapped twice, i.e. each incoming value needs to be mapped to both (automatically imported and manually profile elements)
Consider this as a workaround (and is documented here: https://www.bing.com/search?q=boomi+upsert&qs=n&form=QBRE&msbsrank=6_6__0&sp=-1&pq=boomi+upser&sc=6-11&sk=&cvid=D079824176224A0784999D54BBA879C9)
THe only glitch in the url is that the context is not presented well.. first understand how "on duplicate update" statement works and then the article seems fine.

INSERT INTO iotplanner (city, drivername, driverphone, driverphotoid, earliestinstallation, estimateddelivery, fleetmanager, fleetmanageremailaddress, fleetmanagerphone, gpsterminalnumber, id, installationcomments, installationprovidercontactname, installationprovideremail, installationproviderphone, installationstatus, installer, installeremail, installerphone, installerphotoid, orderid, orderstatus, pincode, state, vehicleregistrationnumber, vehicletype) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE city = ?, drivername = ?, driverphone = ?, driverphotoid = ?, earliestinstallation = ?, estimateddelivery = ?, fleetmanager = ?, fleetmanageremailaddress = ?, fleetmanagerphone = ?, gpsterminalnumber = ?, installationcomments = ?, installationprovidercontactname = ?, installationprovideremail = ?, installationproviderphone = ?, installationstatus = ?, installer = ?, installeremail = ?, installerphone = ?, installerphotoid = ?, orderid = ?, orderstatus = ?, pincode = ?, state = ?, vehicleregistrationnumber = ?, vehicletype = ?;
