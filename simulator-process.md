## Objective
Build a process on top of Boomi integration that can serve as a simulator and testing tool for various purposes (mqtt/database/kafka/http, etc.)

## Project inspiration
The inspiration for this project came due to a need for IOT testing tool, which can feature as a MQTT publisher. The nature of testing involves generating incremental lat/long/temperature data and publishing it to a MQTT broker.
With this pursuit, I ended up paho and experimenting with mqtt cli tools. However, the level of complexity in building an automated data set and then automating the publishing was too high.

## Boomi to the rescue
Boomi Integration service provides a rich featurette of connectors and integration logic inclusive of custom scripting, etc. I decided to take advantage of Boomi Integration to build a simulation tool instead of leveraging docker/linux/windows tools.
This helped me further as my target processes that need to be tested via simulation were deployed on Boomi itself

## Outcome matters

10 flat files created by the process iteratively. Each flat file has a latitude, longitude, temperature and date/time that was iteratively built via a single seed value.

First file (notice 101 is the latitude which is a result of 1 being added to seed value of 100)

Last file (notice 110 as the latitude., at this point the decision shape takes charge and breaks the loop to complete the process)

> In this case, I am dumping the data via disk connector as a bunch of flatfiles. These alternatively can be built as records and pushed through the different connectors available in their own profile formats.
