https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10957000/how-to-change-duplicate-rows-to-unique-values-in-mysql
NOTE THE BELOW WORKS ON MYSQL & DOES NOT WORK ON POSTGRESQL as POSTGRESQL := has some issues on assignment oeprator 
From the above, I have created the below query based on three columns id, value, newvalue (value has to be preserved, newvalue will be a distinct value as shown in post)
This query will not work from phpmyadmin, it has to be executed from mysql prompt
##Table name: abc, column1: id, column2: value, column3: newvalue)

UPDATE abc t1,
(
SELECT 
id as unique_id,
value,
newvalue 
FROM(
SELECT
id,
value,
IF(@ROW = value, @COUNT, @COUNT := 1),
CONCAT(value, ' - ', @COUNT) AS newvalue,
@ROW := value,
@COUNT := @COUNT + 1
FROM abc
JOIN (SELECT @COUNT := 0, @ROW := "") AS t
WHERE value IN(SELECT value FROM abc
GROUP BY value
HAVING COUNT(value) > 1)
) AS abc_test
) as testing
SET t1.newvalue = testing.newvalue where t1.id = testing.unique_id;

<<<<Just logout and login if the above query fails or some weird error>>>>
