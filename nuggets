Issue with flow integration not returning object type to flow
https://community.boomi.com/s/question/0D51W000080XQyVSAW/setting-up-flow-service-server-integration-with-flow-my-message-actions-are-working-however-data-actions-do-not-seem-to-show-up-in-my-service-in-flow-how-do-i-access-my-new-object-type-in-flow-how-do-i-call-my-new-integration-load-process
SOLUTION:
DO NOT IMPORT AN ARRAY REPEATING JSON INTO THE RESPONSE PROFILE.. I ALSO SOLVED IT USING THE LAST COMMENT
Basically modified the iotorder into a single root > object
Instead of the below which I used first and then I did not observe any automatic object types being created in the flow service. 
DID NOT WORK >>>

BASICALLY Arrays and repeating array profiles will not work with flow services integration


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10957000/how-to-change-duplicate-rows-to-unique-values-in-mysql
NOTE THE BELOW WORKS ON MYSQL & DOES NOT WORK ON POSTGRESQL as POSTGRESQL := has some issues on assignment oeprator 
From the above, I have created the below query based on three columns id, value, newvalue (value has to be preserved, newvalue will be a distinct value as shown in post)
This query will not work from phpmyadmin, it has to be executed from mysql prompt
##Table name: abc, column1: id, column2: value, column3: newvalue)

Create a table in MYSQL named test. Create three columns
col1-id | col2-value | col3-newvalue
1       | abc        | 
2       | abc        |

Run the below SQL in phymyadmin for the given database. Execution of the below will result into col3 newvalue populated as abc-1 and abc-2.
Alternatively, go to phpmyadmin > select the DB > routines > Add routine > name the routine, type-procedure, drop the parameter, paste the below in the box and hit GO.
Once saved, you can execute the stored procedure and view the results in the table (newvalue will be populated as abc-1 and abc-2

UPDATE abc t1,
(
SELECT 
id as unique_id,
value,
newvalue 
FROM(
SELECT
id,
value,
IF(@ROW = value, @COUNT, @COUNT := 1),
CONCAT(value, ' - ', @COUNT) AS newvalue,
@ROW := value,
@COUNT := @COUNT + 1
FROM abc
JOIN (SELECT @COUNT := 0, @ROW := "") AS t
WHERE value IN(SELECT value FROM abc
GROUP BY value
HAVING COUNT(value) > 1)
) AS abc_test
) as testing
SET t1.newvalue = testing.newvalue where t1.id = testing.unique_id;

<<<<Just logout and login if the above query fails or some weird error>>>>


####### CONVERTING springboot application.properties to application.yml
Use the http://allencoders.online/converters/props2yaml to convert

####### NEEDED TO USE ADMINER TO CONNECT TO ORACLE-XE.. ADMINER DEFAULT IMAGE DOES NOT HAVE OCI... so needed an alternate image
https://hub.docker.com/r/soivangoi/nginx-php-adminer-oci8
and posted it on my docker

Example:
RUn the XE container 
docker run -d -p 32521:1521 -p 32522:8080 -e ORACLE_ALLOW_REMOTE=true wnameless/oracle-xe-11g-r2:18.04-apex

Optionally run the sqlplus container (NOTE: you are automatically connected to database SYSTEM)
docker run --rm -it loivis/sqlplus system/oracle@//3.142.146.96:32521/XE

Great hack on SQLplus command
https://www.shellhacks.com/oracle-show-databases-sqlplus/

Then run the php-adminer image for oracle-xe
docker run -dit -p 8089:80 soivangoi/nginx-php-adminer-oci8
OR
docker run -dit -p 8089:80 thecloudgarage/oracle-xe-client-adminer
On the host ip-address:port/XE username: system password: oracle

Once logged in You can navigate to SYSTEM DATABASE and create the below sample tables

############################################################
CREATE TABLE contactperson (
  contactpersonempid number(11) NOT NULL,
  contactpersonncity varchar2(50) NOT NULL,
  contactpersonfirstname varchar2(50),

For the last branch iotorders, the key requirment was to automatically set the earliest installation date based on the shipping status.
In doing so, the estimated delivery date  will be incremented by 7 days to create the earliest installation date
However, in cases where shipping status is in processing the estimated delivery date is an empty string
Had to improvise considering two posts

https://community.boomi.com/s/article/add-subtract-day-to-from-date-using-groovy
https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/applications-common/20b/cgsac/groovy-basics.html#to_understanding_the_difference_between_null_and_empty_string

BOOMI GROOVY SCRIPT FOR DATE CHANGES (NOTE THE CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL POST TO INCLUDE IF/ELSE FOR EMPTY STRINGS)
iotorders json profile > keep the estimateddelivery as character itself
iotorders-subid json profile > keep the estimateddelivery and eerliestinstallation as date/time
Within the first subid creation map, create a custom scripting function > groovy 2.5 > inputs: inputDate (Character) , outputs: outputDate
Map the iotorders json profie's earliestdelivery (which is a character) to the inputDate of custom script
Map the custom script's output to the earliestinstallation (which has a date/time property)

If we don't use the if/else function, the script fails and the map fails too...

import java.util.GregorianCalendar;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat

SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
if (inputDate != '') {
Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
c.setTime(sdf.parse(inputDate));
c.add(Calendar.DATE, 30);
// number of days to add, 30 days in this case
outputDate= sdf.format(c.getTime());
}
else {
outputDate = ''
}
