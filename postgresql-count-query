Assume a table called installationstatus in a database installationstatus

state | installationstatus
Karnataka | completed
Karnataka |             (implies blank)

The below query will produce the output

state	    | completed	|  pending
Karnataka	|     1     |	   1

SELECT abcone.state as state, abcone.count as completed, abctwo.count as pending FROM (SELECT state, COUNT(state) FILTER (WHERE installationstatus = 'completed') FROM installationstatus GROUP BY state) AS abcone INNER JOIN (SELECT state, COUNT(state) FILTER (WHERE installationstatus = '') FROM installationstatus GROUP BY state) AS abctwo on abcone.state = abctwo.state
