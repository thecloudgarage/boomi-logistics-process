ACTUAL QUERY used (NOTE For Null values the where condition is written as "WHERE column_name IS NULL)

SELECT completedcount.state as state, completedcount.count as completed, pendingcount.count as pending FROM (SELECT state, COUNT(state) FILTER (WHERE installationstatus = 'completed') FROM iotplanner GROUP BY state) AS completedcount INNER JOIN (SELECT state, COUNT(state) FILTER (WHERE installationstatus IS NULL) FROM iotplanner GROUP BY state) AS pendingcount on completedcount.state = pendingcount.state

Generic example(validated)
Assume a table called installationstatus in a database installationstatus
state | installationstatus
Karnataka | completed
Karnataka |             (implies blank)

The below query will produce the output

state	    | completed	|  pending
Karnataka	|     1     |	   1

SELECT abcone.state as state, abcone.count as completed, abctwo.count as pending FROM (SELECT state, COUNT(state) FILTER (WHERE installationstatus = 'completed') FROM installationstatus GROUP BY state) AS abcone INNER JOIN (SELECT state, COUNT(state) FILTER (WHERE installationstatus = '') FROM installationstatus GROUP BY state) AS abctwo on abcone.state = abctwo.state
